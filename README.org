This is Ablution, a holiday-property management application.

* Tech
It uses [[https://polylith.gitbook.io/polylith/][Polylith]].
A Shadow CLJS / re-frame / re-com frontend, and a Compojure / Ring / XTDB backend.
The two ends communicate using [[https://github.com/edn-format/edn][edn]], as ~application/edn~.
Deployed on AWS using Elastic Beanstalk and Docker Compose.
* Demo
The Ablution UI currently only allows a user to interact with the Supplies domain.
The demo runs on an in-memory database.
* Future plans
Expose the Confirms functionality in the UI.
